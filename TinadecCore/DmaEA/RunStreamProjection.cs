/// The live positions of every run whose stream a client is following, kept in memory so a

///
/// Why this exists: <see cref="FullDuplexRunCoordinator.FollowAsync"/> used to re-read
/// <c>run_stream</c> every 150 ms, so durable storage sat on the render path. A token reached the
/// user only after it had been written, content-hashed and committed, and the poll interval was
/// the floor on how live the stream felt. The durable write is still the record of truth — this
/// type only removes it from the path the user waits on.
///
/// Two properties matter and are the whole design:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>A frame published here is already durable. The publisher calls this after the write
/// returns, so a reader can never show something a crash would lose, and the terminal frame and
/// the run's terminal status are observed in the same order.</item>
/// <item>It is only a cache of positions, never the answer. Dropping everything (a restart, an
/// eviction) costs nothing: the reader falls back to replaying the durable stream from its
/// cursor, which is exactly what recovery already does.</item>
/// </list>
